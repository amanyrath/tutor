# Productionalization Roadmap: From Prototype to Production

## Executive Summary
This roadmap transforms the Tutor Quality Dashboard from a working prototype into a production-grade system trusted by operations leaders and executives.  
The emphasis is on **data integrity, verification, operational control, and stakeholder confidence** — ensuring every recommendation is traceable, every campaign approved, and every AI-driven insight validated.

- **Current State:** Prototype functional (dashboard, AI insights, interventions)  
- **Goal:** Production-ready system with verified data, monitored models, controlled workflows, and executive visibility  
- **Timeline:** 75–90 days  
- **Critical Success Factor:** Parallel data development stream executed alongside productionalization

## Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| 1. Discovery & Alignment | Days 1–5 | Validate use cases, align with stakeholders, plan execution | Approved requirements, work breakdown, AI prompt framework |
| 2. Data Development (Parallel) | Days 6–45 | Build robust data foundations and feature pipelines | Verified data, feature engineering, model benchmarks |
| 3. Production Infrastructure & Verification | Days 6–30 | Deploy production environment, implement model validation & monitoring | Operational database, verification pipelines, monitoring system |
| 4. Admin Tools & Traceability | Days 31–55 | Enable transparency and control for recommendations & campaigns | Admin dashboards, approval workflows, traceability view |
| 5. Polish & Launch Prep | Days 56–75 | Optimize performance, secure system, finalize documentation | Secure, optimized, fully documented system ready for production |

## Phase Summaries

### 1. Discovery & Alignment (Days 1–5)
**Objective:** Establish alignment on goals, workflows, and success metrics.

- Conduct user and SME interviews to define real-world needs
- Build and demo interactive prototypes to surface decision points
- Align executives on verification, approval, and success criteria
- Finalize work breakdown and define AI-assisted development prompts

**Outcome:** Shared understanding, approved scope, structured execution plan

---

### 2. Data Development & Feature Engineering (Days 6–45, Parallel Track)
**Objective:** Create a reliable, scalable data foundation to power engagement and quality insights

- Execute EDA, feature selection, and model baselining
- Automate data validation and quality monitoring pipelines
- Deliver end-to-end feature engineering and discovery process

**Outcome:** Verified, production-grade dataset and feature pipeline supporting model reliability

---

### 3. Production Infrastructure & Verification (Days 6–30)
**Objective:** Deploy production-grade infrastructure and build system trust through verification

- Stand up production database, logging, and monitoring stack
- Build verification layer for all AI outputs (model accuracy, drift, relevance)
- Establish campaign approval and intervention audit workflows

**Outcome:** Operational production system with full transparency and quality assurance

---

### 4. Admin Tools & Traceability (Days 31–55)
**Objective:** Provide operations and executives with end-to-end visibility and control

- Develop traceability and approval dashboards
- Implement system health, data quality, and performance reporting
- Enable export and executive reporting capabilities

**Outcome:** All recommendations and campaigns fully traceable and auditable, with executive-level insights

---

### 5. Polish & Launch Preparation (Days 56–75)
**Objective:** Optimize, secure, and finalize for production launch

- Performance optimization and responsive UX
- Security audit, authentication, and role-based permissions
- Documentation for users, admins, and executives
- Load and acceptance testing prior to launch

**Outcome:** Production-ready system with stakeholder sign-off and monitoring plan
